        <p>
            My name is Sofia Saldana, and I am an international student currently taking the interactive media design
            program at Algonquin College. This is my first post-secondary education after finishing high school back in
            my home country. I'm from Panama City, Panama, and my first language is Spanish; I learned English mainly
            through social media, watching youtube, and reading.

            I am a self-taught artist; I have been drawing for most of my life and have a passion for everything that is
            design and art related. This passion motivated me to take this program since it focuses on design and also
            tackles so many different areas. I'm motivated, and I want to take the most knowledge out of this program to
            implement it in my professional career.</p>
